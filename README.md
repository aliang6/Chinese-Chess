# Chinese-Chess
Chinese Chess board game written using Java and JavaFX

## Audience
Players of Chinese Chess who want to play the board game on the computer rather than on a real life board. 

## Experience
The user compiles the java files and opens the start screen to be greeted with four buttons: 'Start', 'About', 'Load', and 'Exit'. Clicking the 'Start' button brings the user to another screen with the game board and two other buttons: 'Save' and 'Exit'.
